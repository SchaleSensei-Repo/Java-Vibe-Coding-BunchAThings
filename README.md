## CI/CD Integration

This project uses a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline, as defined in the [Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile):

- **Build Automation:**  
  - Recursively finds all Java files with a `public static void main` method.
  - Compiles each application with dependencies from the `libs/` directory.
  - Packages each app as a `.jar` in the `out/` directory.

- **Release Packaging:**  
  - Collects all built `.jar` files into a `release_package/` directory.
  - Compresses the release package as a `.zip` archive.

- **GitHub Release Automation:**  
  - Automatically creates a new GitHub release for each build.
  - Uploads the zipped release package to GitHub using the provided credentials.

- **Notifications:**  
  - Sends email notifications on build success or failure.

**Pipeline Highlights:**
- [Jenkinsfile](Jenkinsfile) is fully declarative and supports parallel builds.
- External dependencies are managed via the `libs/` directory.
- Release artifacts are versioned and published automatically.
