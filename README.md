# Java-Vibe-Coding-BunchAThings
A repo for Bunch of small java application

BIG NOTE : All of Java Applications are fully written from AI with some minor changes from me.

Reasons why i have this little applications and upload it to repository?
my reasons is : 
 - For the little applications : I find the AI fascinating in terms of capability to create some simple applications and help me to make some of my idea into actual applications
 - For the repository : I create this repository for my hobby needs and practical learning in the world of repository and CI/CD world. For now it is small repository and does not have CI/CD workflows, in a future i plan for some lint, SAST/DAST and some Jenkins workflow if possible
