## About This Repo

**Big Note:**  
All applications here are initially generated by AI, with some modifications by me.

**Why does this repo exist?**
- I enjoy experimenting with AI-generated code and turning my ideas into real Java applications.
- This repository serves as my playground for hobby projects and practical learning about repositories and (eventually) CI/CD workflows.

Feel free to:
- Clone this repo to explore or use the applications.
- Modify and improve these little apps â€” contributions are always welcome!
